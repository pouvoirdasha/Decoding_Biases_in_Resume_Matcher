In this paper, we propose an investigation into an automatic resume screening algorithm. Our goal is to test whether such an algorithm can be subject to biases regarding gender, ethnicity, job sector or ideology. We find that the algorithm selected - open source Resume-Matcher - exhibits gender and racial bias with statistically significant variations between job sectors. We also propose an innovative research protocol that allows to produce high-quality synthetic resume datasets with minimal computing power.
